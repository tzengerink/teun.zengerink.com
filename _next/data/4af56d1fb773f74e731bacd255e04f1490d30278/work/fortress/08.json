What happens to the products after their life span has expired, is non-essential. Take, Make, Waste.\n\nThe impact of this mode of life on our habitat is big. This project is the result of a search for how this thinking pattern shapes the Western Harber of Amsterdam. Most of the time the effects are clearly visible in an industrial area. Sometimes the truth is disguised and hidden beneath the surface.\n","photos":[{"key":"01","caption":"Transshipment terminal at a former refinery.
